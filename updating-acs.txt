When updating to new version:

Extract all deps, and make sure header files points to deps correctly, then run this sharpie command:
Make sure you have latest sharpie version.
Latest is NOT what is shown at ms docs.. docs say 3.4,
but 3.5 is latest as of now, download from here: http://aka.ms/objective-sharpie

Run this command:
sharpie bind -sdk iphoneos14.0 -o tmp -scope NativeSDK/AzureCommunicationCalling.framework/Headers NativeSDK/AzureCommunicationCalling.framework/Headers/AzureCommunicationCalling.h -c -fmodules

Edit generated files to fix namesapce, and any "Verify".
Also, remove the generated nested Action\<Action\< attribute (constructor), which mono doesnt like

Then copy files into binding lib
